- My Hobbies are playing cricket, reading novels and Cooking.
- I have little experience in Python, SQL. 
- I have interest in data analysis field where i would like to learn the insights from data. 

<sub> To start with my undergrad I only had experience with C programming and Basics of Java, however after my undergrad I was interested in learning python. So I have taken python classes, with SQL i have added another techinical skills. I am still learning both the languages.</sub>

- Cooking is an art, however, everyone can’t be an artist. Well, now we are here to help to bring out that hidden artist inside in all of you, and also make everyone love cooking.
- So We came up with this Idea where the user can select a food item and get the recipe or select the items which are available and based on that we can get the list of food Items that can be prepared.
- Hence we are proposing “The Cook Book”, a modern recipe-sharing website, which aims to provide users with a variety of food recipes from healthy to various gourmet, super quick to fine culinary dishes with the ingredients available to the user.
- A user can register on the website and can browse through a variety of recipes with the help of the powerful search feature with sorting and filtering, user can retrieve recipes based on the ingredients provided, user can also like a recipe, provide comments and reviews on recipes and upload own recipes and contribute to the system. A user can also filter out the recipes based on the number of likes.
